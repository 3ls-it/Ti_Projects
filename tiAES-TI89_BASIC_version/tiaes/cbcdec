cbcdec(cs,w)
Prgm
(c) string, mat
(c) takes a cipher string and the key schedule

Local ps,i,sl,mb,tb,iv,ivs

dim(cs)->sl
(c) empty plaintext string
""->ps

(c) get CBC initialization vector
mid(cs,1,32)->ivs
get_iv(ivs)->iv

For i,33,sl,32
    (c) encrypted chars are represented by 2 hex digits
    (c) so we grab 32 cyphertext digits at a time
    (c) str_ord() coverts hex to dec
    str_ord(mid(cs,i,32))->st
    (c) copy state to a temp block
    st->tb
    decr(w)
    st xor iv->st
    ps&ord_char(st)->ps
    (c) temp block becomes the next IV
    tb->iv
EndFor

ps->out
